    <h1>Europe</h1>
    <p>For the Geographical space it occupies, Europe has a the greatest diversity of cultures
    compared to any other Continent in the World. Getting between countries is very easy background
    there are excellent long distances coached (such as Flixbus) which regularly do routes across
    a number of countries.</p>

   <h1>Asia</h1>
   <p> South East Asia has to be my favourite part of the World. It is my Winter destination as it provides
     great weather when it is grey and miserable in the UK. It has the advantage of being relaltively cheap
   compared to most of the rest of the World and unlike South America, English is spoken widely
   in most countries</p>

  <h1>South America</h1>
  <p> South America like Asia is also very cheap, it has seen massive decline in exchange rates in recent
    years meaning it is now very good value of holidays. Like Asia being Southern hemisphere it is a good
    time to visit during the English Winter months. Unlike Asia it is not easy to get be understood
    unless you know some Spanish. This can be true even within the Capital cities.
